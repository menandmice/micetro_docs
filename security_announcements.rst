Security announcements
======================

--------------

Vulnerabilities were found in the ISC DHCP software running on our virtual appliances.

* `CVE-2021-25217 <https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25217>`_: code used by the ISC DHCP package can be exploited by an attacker to read a stored lease that contains option information which will trigger a bug in the option parsing code. Due to shared code, multiple components like ``dhcpd`` and ``dhclient`` are affected.

We have updated the Men&Mice Virtual Appliances with the appropriate patch, and recommend all customers to update to the latest 10.0.2 version as soon as possible.

The appliances can be easily upgraded using the Automatic Updates feature of Micetro.

For details on how to update Micetro, see :ref:`updates`.

For more information regarding the upgrade, contact Men&Mice Customer Care. See :ref:`support`.
