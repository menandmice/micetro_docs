11.0.0
------
February 29, 2024

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **BDDS**: Micetro now supports BDDS appliances from BlueCat, this is a new feature intended for customers that want to add BDDS appliances into their existing network infrastructure and manage them in Micetro along with other DNS/DHCP servers that they already have. The following functionality can be managed on BDDS appliances within Micetro

   * BIND options which allows viewing and editing DNS options on BIND, both for DNS servers and zones
   * Dynamic DNS updates
   * Network interfaces
   * Network services such as DNS, DHCP, NTP, resolv.conf and SNMP
   * Syslog redirection which provides the flexibility to define multiple remote logging servers, meeting a variety of logging needs.
   * Updates of BDDS appliances from within Micetro
* **ISC DHCP failover**: ISC DHCP server-to-server failover relationships can now be managed within the Micetro
* **Kea 2.4**: Micetro can now manage Kea 2.4 DHCP servers
* **Kea failover**: Kea DHCP server-to-server failover relationships can now be managed within Micetro
* **Kea premium hooks**: Micetro can now use Kea premium hooks in order to increase performance when working with Kea
* **Micetro log**: Micetro logs can now be viewed from Admin > Logging > Micetro Logs. The logging output is improved with better structure and coloring. This greatly improves working with the Micetro log for not only customers but also Micetro developers and the customers support team
* **Undo**: When viewing the history of events users can now choose to undo certain events, effectively reverting the change. These events are

   * Create/delete/modify DNS records
   * Custom property edits
   * All create history events

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* **HA support for mmws**: Session handling has been moved from mmws to the Central server. This allows customers to have multiple mmWSs configured for redundancy, region, or load balancing reasons
* **Multi-factor authentication**: Setup and configuration of multi-factor authentication is now much simpler than before. In the web UI it is now possible to navigate to Admin -> Configuration -> Authentication and there users can configure the fields needed for the integration with Okta (client id, redirect uri, scope etc.) and also test if that configuration is correct
* **New remote for BIND**: There has been a new remote implemented for BIND which has all the same functionality as the old remote but also allows management of RPZ and dynamic zones
* **Subscription license**: Handling of license keys has been changed to include subscription keys and allow longer expiration times

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Added support for Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
* When changing the state of DNS zone from static to dynamic then all existing records are shown correctly, this fixes an issue where the existing records disappeard and then re-appered again in the web UI
* Reduced the excessive timeout when trying to acquire initial connection to agents
* Senstive SNMP information is not logged out to the object history
* Object history entries are now created for the NS record within a DNS zone
* TTL can now be edited for Akamai Edge record sets in the web UI
* Server grids in the web UI are now reloaded after synchronization
* Switching address spaces does now reload service management view in the web UI

Deprecated features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are number of features and functionality that are being deprecated in version 11.0. To clarify, this version will be the last one where these feature are guaranteed to work and if necessary there will be patches of 11.0 provided for these features. A feature might continue to work in future major/minor releases as long as the relevant code is present in the Micetro solution but there are no guarantees for that as the code is not officially maintained. Following is a list of the features that are being deprecated

* BIND 9.16 and earlier has been deprecated as as this version has been declared as end of life by ISC in Q1 2024, the same applies for the subscriber edition.
* Dyn has been deprecated because it is not supported anymore by Oracle. The target retirement date was 31 May 2023, which as already passed. For more information see `here <https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/dyn/technologies/enterprise-customer-faq.html>`_
* ISC DHCP 4.4.0 and earlier has been deprecated, 4.4.1 and later will continue to be supported by Micetro even though support for ISC DHCP as whole was dropped by ISC itself in December 2022. This is because ISC DHCP is still widely used by Micetro customers and will likely continue to be so for some time.
* Kea 2.0 has been deprecated as a service that Micetro can overlay, this is because this version has reached end-of-life and is no longer supported by ISC. See the roadmap for ISC Kea `here <https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00896>`_. It should also be noted that support for older versions of Kea are of course deprecated as well
* Men & Mice appliances have been deprecated as a result of adding the support for BDDS appliances, it is recommended that all customers that are using either physical or virtual Men & Mice appliances migrate over to BDDS appliances as soon as possible. As a result of this, support for Unbound was also deprecated as the Men & Mice appliances were the main reason for that support in Micetro
* Microsoft SQL Server 2012 has been deprecated as this database went to end of support at 12 July 2022. The same applies for older versions of Microsoft SQL Server. For more information on Microsoft SQL Server roadmap see `here <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products>`_
* Python 3.7 has been depreated in Micetro because it was end of life in June 2023 according to the [python release cycle](https://devguide.python.org/versions/). All python scripts such as those used in scheduled scripts or MFA will have to be updated accordingly
* OpenStack has been deprecated as well as the versions that are currently supported in Micetro are already end of life so it was decided to drop this support instead of adding support for newer versions
* PostgreSQL 11 is also deprecated as this database was out of support November 9 2023. For more information on the PostgreSQL roadmap see `here <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/>`_
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS support has been deprecated because this version is out of support in Q1 2024 according to the `Ubuntu release cycle <https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle>`_
* Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 are being deprecated because Microsoft announced end of support at 10 October 2023. Needless to say older versions of Windows Server are not supported either. This deprecation applies both for hosting the Micetro solution itself and as a DNS/DHCP server that Micetro can overlay

.. _10.5.6-release:

10.5.6
------
January 31, 2024

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Resolved an issue where the creation and deletion of A records were wrongly logged twice in event history.

* Fixed an issue that led to the web service crashing when filter parameters were sent without the required filter keyword.

* Resolved an issue in ISC DHCP failover scopes, where leases marked as "released" were not correctly recognized as free.

* Fixed an issue where the system encountered difficulty in locating the ``PythonExecutablePath`` when it contained spaces.

* Fixed an issue where users who selected IPAM as their default landing page would sometimes receive an invalid session error upon logging in.

.. _10.5.5-release:

10.5.5
------
December 5, 2023

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Issue: Micetro Unable to Locate Python Executable with Spaces in Path*

Micetro experiences difficulty locating the Python executable when the ``PythonExecutablePath`` preference points to a path that contains spaces, impacting external and LDAP authentication configurations.

**Workarounds**:

* Add the Python path to the ``PATH`` environment variable in Windows.

-OR-

* Encase the ``PythonExecutablePath`` preference value with quotation marks on either side. Example: ``<PythonExecutablePath value="&quot;C:\Path with spaces\python.exe&quot;"/>``

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* **Enhanced Session ID Algorithm**: Weâ€™ve updated the algorithm for generating session IDs. It now uses non-deterministic random values that are automatically seeded from the underlying OS, improving security and unpredictability. This improvement addresses the security vulnerability outlined in CVE-2023-4080.

* **Script Name Fields**: The script name fields (:menuselection:`Admin --> Configuration --> Event Hooks`) now only accept script names and validate the existence of the script in a folder named "scripts" under Central's data folder. Default paths are "C:\\ProgramData\\Men and Mice\\Central\\scripts" on Windows and /var/mmsuite/mmcentral/scripts on Linux. This improvement addresses the security vulnerability outlined in CVE-2023-4079.

  While existing values for script names will continue to function, updating the value requires moving referenced scripts to the scripts folder before they can be selected in the UI.

  The system setting "Folder for scripts to be run from the API" (RunCommandsFromDirectory) has been deprecated. The current value remains functional but cannot be modified, only cleared. The default value is the scripts folder mentioned above. Scripts invoked through the RunCommand API should also be moved to the scripts folder.

  The 'parameters' argument to the RunCommand API has been deprecated.

  While these changes are not breaking, administrators are advised to take necessary actions, as all script invocations are expected to be limited to the scripts folder in a future major release.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Resolved an issue where SNMP profiles were not displayed in the table when the number of profiles exceeded a specific threshold.

* Fixed an issue where records in recently promoted AuthServe zones could not be edited.

* Addressed an error where the importing of host records for IP addresses would fail.	

* Resolved slowness issues when deleting a zone with a few records from AuthServe. Improved performance when deleting a zone on a Central with a PostgreSQL database.

* Various bug fixes and improvements.

September 11, 2023

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* **Default TTL Configuration**: Introducing a new system setting that allows users to customize the default Time To Live (TTL) for records created within zones belonging to xDNS profiles. that are in xDNS profiles.	This feature provides enhanced flexibility in managing your DNS records.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Enhanced Central's handling of HTTPS certificates by now supporting multiple Certificate Authority (CA) files. Additionally, you can no longer select the Strict policy without specifying a CA file or directory, reinforcing security practices.

* Fixed a bug where Micetro would not function as expected when managing BIND servers with Catalog zones.

* Fixed a bug that previously prevented the successful creation of a DHCP scope on all relevant DHCP servers when converting a range. 

.. _10.5.2-release:

10.5.2
------
July 11, 2023

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* **Duplicate Network**: This feature allows you to easily duplicate networks along with their subranges, DHCP scopes and configurations under a new network address. Please note that this feature is  currently not supported for Cisco scopes, Cloud networks, and ranges in a non-CIDR format.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
