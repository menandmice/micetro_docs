.. _11.0.4-release:

11.0.4
------
September 16, 2024

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Resolved a problem that prevented users from logging into the Micetro Web Interface following an upgrade to a new license key version when the default home page was configured to the DNS or IPAM view.
* Fixed an issue where the DNS server list (DHCP option 6 on MS DHCP) in the Micetro Web Interface was previously sorting by IP address instead of the user-defined order. The order of DNS servers in DHCP option 6 is now preserved in the Web Interface.
* Resolved an issue where field validation failed during DHCP scope conversion:
* Fixed an issue where unintended user input in the filter field caused Central to stop.
* Resolved a problem where a field name in filters would be matched to a column even if it was only a partial match.
* Fixed a regression that allowed users to modify the names and descriptions of built-in groups.
* Fixed the import of TXT records that contain semicolons.
* The ``AddDHCPReservation`` function no longer supports referencing reservations by name for Kea.
* Change requests can now reference reservations by address, in addition to name. For ISC reservations with multiple addresses, the system will now verify if any of the addresses match.

.. _11.0.3-release:

11.0.3
------
July 23, 2024

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* BIND has been upgraded to v9.16.50 (along with patches from ISC) on the Micetro appliances to address the following security vulnerabilities:
   * CVE-2024-0760: A flood of DNS messages over TCP may make the server unstable 
   * CVE-2024-1737: BIND’s database will be slow if a very large number of RRs exist at the same name
   * CVE-2024-1975: SIG(0) can be used to exhaust CPU resources
   * CVE-2024-4076: Assertion failure when serving both stale cache data and authoritative zone content

Please note that when updating the Micetro appliances it is necessary to restart them for the change to take full effect, this usually takes about 20-30 seconds.

MDDS appliances have also been updated to include a BIND version that contains those security fixes, this will result in a restart of the BIND service which will only take few seconds

.. _11.0.2-release:

11.0.2
------
July 8, 2024

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Improved concurrency safety with GetNextFreeAddress when used with the temporaryClaimTime parameter.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed a problem where a minor version of MDDS was not detected correctly.
* Improved concurrency safety with GetNextFreeAddress when used in conjunction with the temporaryClaimTime parameter.
* Fixed a problem with the calculation of the usage and the display of the leases in the scopes on certain MS DHCP servers.
* Fixed an issue where Swagger documentation did not allow selecting an HTTPS connection for REST calls. The default server in Open API no longer includes a protocol, ensuring that REST documentation works seamlessly for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.
* Fixed an issue where DHCP Synchronization would fail because the DHCP scope change listener could not be found. The reliability of DHCP synchronization for Microsoft DHCP servers has been enhanced.
* Fixed an issue where downloading updates through a proxy failed unless the CONNECT verb was allowed for regular HTTP traffic. We’ve also enabled checking for and downloading updates via HTTPS when a web proxy server is configured.

.. _11.0.1-release:

11.0.1
------
May 15, 2024

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed an issue with Azure setups containing more than 1000 zones. Previously, Micetro would fail reading in zones from Azure if the number of zones exceeded 1000.
* Fixed an issue where explicit session removals could lead to a potential out-of-memory condition in the web service.
* Fixed an issue where rolling back changes when adding zones to xDNS failed, resulting in the deletion of the zones.
* Fixed an issue where adding a DNS server and simultaneously attempting to add a zone within the same session led to intermittent failures.
* Fixed an issue in ISC failover where the split between failover peers would change when adding a scope from the secondary server to a failover relationship.
* Fixed a bug that affected the interpretation of Azure DNS records containing hostname data, leading to inaccuracies in record processing.

.. _11.0.0-release:

11.0.0
------
March 14, 2024

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **MDDS Support**: Micetro now supports MDDS appliances from BlueCat. This feature is intended for customers seeking to seamlessly incorporate MDDS appliances into their existing network infrastructure and manage them within Micetro alongside their other DNS/DHCP servers. With this enhancement, users can manage various functionalities on MDDS appliances within Micetro, including:

   * BIND options that allow viewing and editing DNS options on BIND for both DNS servers and zones.
   * Dynamic DNS updates.
   * Network interfaces.
   * Network services such as DNS, DHCP, NTP, resolv.conf, and SNMP.
   * Syslog redirection offering the flexibility to define multiple remote logging servers, meeting a variety of logging needs.
   * MDDS appliance updates from within Micetro.
* **ISC DHCP Failover**: Micetro now enables the management of ISC DHCP server-to-server failover relationships.
* **Kea 2.4 Integration**: Micetro now supports the management of Kea 2.4 DHCP servers.
* **Kea Failover Management**: Users can now manage Kea DHCP server-to-server failover relationships within Micetro.
* **Kea Premium Hooks**: Micetro can now use Kea premium hooks to increase performance when working with Kea.
* **Enhanced Micetro Log**: Micetro logs can now be viewed from :menuselection:`Admin --> Logging --> Micetro Logs`. The logging output is improved with better structure and colorization, greatly improving usability for not only customers, but also Micetro developers and support teams.
* **Undo Functionality**: Users can now undo certain events while viewing event change history, effectively reverting the change. These events are:

   * Creation, deletion, or modification of DNS records.
   * Edits to custom properties.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* **High Availability (HA) Support for mmWS**: Session handling has been moved from mmWS to the Central server. This allows customers to configure multiple mmWS instances for redundancy, region, or load balancing purposes.
* **External and Multifactor Authentication**: Setting up external authentication has been streamlined with the integration of Python scripts for LDAP and external authentication directly into the installation and upgrading process. Users can now easily configure integration with Okta and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) by navigating to :menuselection:`Admin --> Configuration --> Authentication`. Additionally, a built-in test feature allows users to test if that configuration is correct. 
* **New Remote for BIND**: Users can now manage Response Policy Zones (RPZ) and dynamic zones.
* **Enhanced License Key Handling**: Handling of license keys has been changed to include subscription keys and allow for longer expiration times.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed an issue where existing records disappeared and reappeared again. Now all existing records are shown correctly when changing the state of DNS zone from static to dynamic. 
* Excessive timeouts when trying to establish initial connections to agents have been significantly reduced.
* Sensitive SNMP information is no longer logged in the object history.
* Object history entries are now created for the NS record within DNS zones.
* Fixed an issue where users were unable to edit the TTL (Time To Live) for Akamai Edge record sets in the Web Interface.
* Server grids in the web UI are now reloaded after synchronization.
* Switching address spaces now reloads the Service Management view.

Deprecation Announcements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We've launched the new Micetro DNS/DHCP server (MDDS) appliance, marking a transition from the old Men&Mice virtual appliance platform. If you're using the Men&Mice virtual appliance and considering an upgrade to Micetro 11.0, please reach out to our support team at support@bluecatnetworks.com for assistance with migrating smoothly to the new platform. It's important to note that all customers will need to transition to the new appliance platform eventually, so we highly recommend making this change in the upgrade to version 11.0.
* OpenStack support is deprecated as the versions currently supported in Micetro have reached end-of-life status.
* Dyn support is deprecated as it is no longer supported by Oracle, with the target retirement date being May 31, 2023. For more information, see `here <https://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisitions/dyn/technologies/enterprise-customer-faq.html>`_.
----

* Support for BIND versions 9.16 and earlier is deprecated, as these versions have been declared as end-of-life by ISC in Q1 2024. The same applies to the subscriber edition.
* Support for ISC DHCP versions 4.4.0 and earlier is deprecated. However, versions 4.4.1 and later will continue to be supported by Micetro, despite ISC dropping support for ISC DHCP as a whole in December 2022. This is because ISC DHCP is still widely used by Micetro customers and will likely continue to be so for some time.
* Support for Kea version 2.0 as a service that Micetro can overlay is deprecated due to reaching end-of-life status and no longer being supported by ISC. See the roadmap for ISC Kea `here <https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00896>`_. It should be noted that support for older versions of Kea is deprecated as well.
----

* Support for Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 is deprecated because Microsoft announced end of support on October 10, 2023. This applies both to hosting the Micetro solution itself and as a DNS/DHCP server that Micetro can overlay.
* Support for Microsoft SQL Server 2012 and older versions is deprecated as these databases reached end of support on July 12, 2022. For more information on Microsoft SQL Server roadmap, see `here <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products>`_.
* Support for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is deprecated as this version reached end of support in Q1 2024 according to the `Ubuntu release cycle <https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle>`_.
* PostgreSQL 11 is also deprecated as this database was out of support November 9 2023. For more information on the PostgreSQL roadmap see `here <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/>`_
* Python 3.7 has been deprecated in Micetro due to its end of life in June 2023, according to the `python release cycle <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>`_. All Python scripts, including those used in scheduled scripts or MFA (multifactor authentication), will need to be updated accordingly.

.. _10.5.8-release:

10.5.8
------
June 20, 2024

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Improved functionality to automatically detect if an AWS account in a multi-account setup has been granted DNS access in Micetro.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed an issue where rolling back changes when adding zones to xDNS failed, resulting in the deletion of the zones.

.. _10.5.7-release:

10.5.7
------
February 13, 2024

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* BIND has been upgraded to v9.16.47 on the Micetro appliance to address the following security vulnerabilities:

   * CVE-2023-4408: Parsing large DNS messages may cause excessive CPU load.
   * CVE-2023-5517: Querying RFC 1918 reverse zones may cause an assertion failure when "nxdomain-redirect" is enabled.
   * CVE-2023-5679: Enabling both DNS64 and serve-stale may cause an assertion failure during recursive resolution.
   * CVE-2023-6516: Specific recursive query patterns may lead to an out-of-memory condition.
   * CVE-2023-50387: KeyTrap: Extreme CPU consumption in DNSSEC validator.
   * CVE-2023-50868: High CPU consumption in DNSSEC validator.

.. _10.5.6-release:

10.5.6
------
January 31, 2024

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Resolved an issue where the creation and deletion of A records were wrongly logged twice in event history.

* Fixed an issue that led to the web service crashing when filter parameters were sent without the required filter keyword.

* Resolved an issue in ISC DHCP failover scopes, where leases marked as "released" were not correctly recognized as free.

* Fixed an issue where the system encountered difficulty in locating the ``PythonExecutablePath`` when it contained spaces.

* Fixed an issue where users who selected IPAM as their default landing page would sometimes receive an invalid session error upon logging in.

.. _10.5.5-release:

10.5.5
------
December 5, 2023

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Issue: Micetro Unable to Locate Python Executable with Spaces in Path*

Micetro experiences difficulty locating the Python executable when the ``PythonExecutablePath`` preference points to a path that contains spaces, impacting external and LDAP authentication configurations.

**Workarounds**:

* Add the Python path to the ``PATH`` environment variable in Windows.

-OR-

* Encase the ``PythonExecutablePath`` preference value with quotation marks on either side. Example: ``<PythonExecutablePath value="&quot;C:\Path with spaces\python.exe&quot;"/>``

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* **Enhanced Session ID Algorithm**: We’ve updated the algorithm for generating session IDs. It now uses non-deterministic random values that are automatically seeded from the underlying OS, improving security and unpredictability. This improvement addresses the security vulnerability outlined in CVE-2023-4080.

* **Script Name Fields**: The script name fields (:menuselection:`Admin --> Configuration --> Event Hooks`) now only accept script names and validate the existence of the script in a folder named "scripts" under Central's data folder. Default paths are "C:\\ProgramData\\Men and Mice\\Central\\scripts" on Windows and /var/mmsuite/mmcentral/scripts on Linux. This improvement addresses the security vulnerability outlined in CVE-2023-4079.

  While existing values for script names will continue to function, updating the value requires moving referenced scripts to the scripts folder before they can be selected in the UI.

  The system setting "Folder for scripts to be run from the API" (RunCommandsFromDirectory) has been deprecated. The current value remains functional but cannot be modified, only cleared. The default value is the scripts folder mentioned above. Scripts invoked through the RunCommand API should also be moved to the scripts folder.

  The 'parameters' argument to the RunCommand API has been deprecated.

  While these changes are not breaking, administrators are advised to take necessary actions, as all script invocations are expected to be limited to the scripts folder in a future major release.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Resolved an issue where SNMP profiles were not displayed in the table when the number of profiles exceeded a specific threshold.

* Fixed an issue where records in recently promoted AuthServe zones could not be edited.

* Addressed an error where the importing of host records for IP addresses would fail.	

* Resolved slowness issues when deleting a zone with a few records from AuthServe. Improved performance when deleting a zone on a Central with a PostgreSQL database.

* Various bug fixes and improvements.
