New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The Men&Mice Suite is now called \*drumroll please* **Micetro by Men&Mice**. Cue the (sheet) music.

* We talked about this many times, but at the risk of parroting (<snicker>) ourselves: ISC Kea 1.6 and 1.8 is now a fully supported DHCP server. Enjoy modern, high availability DHCP!

* We’ve felt guilty for enjoying the famous Icelandic pools with just ourselves. So now you can get a piece of that action and manage DHCP pools in the Web Application.

* You can now manage DNS and DHCP servers, and Men&Mice Virtual Appliances in the Web Application.

* Are you one of those people who likes to update? We’re too! Micetro works with MS SQL Server 2019 now, the latest and greatest, so have at it.

* If you’re not a fan of MS SQL or SQLite, worry not: Men&Mice Central can now be configured to use PostgreSQL as its database backend.

* G-(Wo)Man? Enjoy managing your services in Azure Government cloud through Micetro and be Free(man).

* Logging in to the Web Application before adding license keys in the Management Console sometimes created awkward situations, so now you can add your license keys in the Web Application without slowing your roll.

* You can now promote secondary zones to primary zones in the Web Application.

* Windows DNS users can now manage all their zone transfer and notify settings in the Web Application.

* We heard you liked DNS records, so we’ve put support for new record types in the Web Application: WKS, RP, AFSDB, LOC, SSHFP, SPF, DNSKEY (read only), NSEC (read only), NSEC3 (read only), NSEC3PARAM, RRSIG (read only), DS, DLV (read only).

* You can now manage users, groups and roles in the Web Application. Group hug!

* Static-stub zones are now supported in the Web Application

* Some of y’all wanted search instead of filtering, so now you can switch the Quickfilter to a Quicksearch and back again. The Quickfilter will only show the matching records in the grid, while Quicksearch will highlight them but still display all other objects as well.

* You can import DNS records into a zone with an “Import” task in the Web Application’s DNS context. No muss, no fuss.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The Web Application now conforms to the WCAG Accessibility standard.

* The "Related DHCP data" section in sidebar for IP addresses now includes a list of leases that are attached to the IP address. Like a Thanksgiving guest list, but make it DDI.

* You can select a DHCP server and view all the DHCP scopes without rummaging around in the UI.

* When you’re creating a new DNS zone, record, or network or DHCP scope, Micetro will use the selected item in the left sidebar as the default value.

* An ellipsis menu has been added to list rows that provides action shortcuts for its respective object to make you (even more of) a DDI ninja.

* When you’re logged in through a domain, you can no longer change your password. No cheating you sly foxes you.

* The network list is now automatically updated after a ping is done.

* The allocation wizard for IP address ranges in the Management Console and the old web interface no longer copies read-only custom properties.

* The “preference” field in NAPTR DNS records is now a required field.

* The SNMP discovery has been improved, so virtual switches can be better identified uniquely.

* You can filter by the ‘Type’ column when editing zone authority.

* You can now find ‘Actions’ conveniently on the top, instead of in the Inspector.

* Indicators for server states have been improved. They were a tad bit confusing, which made you confused which made us sad. Now we can all be happy.

* Filtering a range that contains the IP address will no longer match the root range.

* Micetro now properly updates the ‘Last seen’ column if an IP address responds to an ad-hoc ping.

* Akamai Fast DNS server support has been added to the Web Application.

* Improved AWS multi-account discovery performance and security.

* Detach/Attach used to be called Disable/Enable, which wasn’t really accurate since they did not disable/enable but detach/attach stuff. So now they’re called Detach/Attach. Nomen est omen.

* Validating the values specified for custom property drop-down fields is now case insensitive. We’re not casists.

* Quick Command now displays authority/view if it finds multiple copies of a zone to make it, well, quicker.

* The ‘Recent DNS zones’ and ‘Recent ranges’ in the filtering sidebar are now expanded by default. You can also select them to open the zone/range.

* When you press the reload button inside a zone, Micetro does a DNS synchronization with the DNS server so you get crispy fresh data.
