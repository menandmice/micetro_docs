Manage DNS records in Micetro.

In DNS it is very common to have multiple entries with the same name, as the example below shows.

::

  mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   A      192.0.2.25
  mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   A      192.0.2.143
  mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   AAAA   2001:db8::25
  mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   AAAA   2001:db8::587

.. tip::
  To enable multiple records with the same name in the Ansible modules, there is no possibility to change a record, the only way is to add the new record with the updated data and remove the old one after that.

Options
^^^^^^^

aging:
  The aging timestamp of dynamic records in AD integrated zones. Hours since January 1, 1601, UTC. Providing a non-zero value creates a dynamic record.

data:

  Example: data: ``"100 10 U E2U+sip !^.*$!sip:customer-service@example.com! ."``

dnszone:
  (required) The DNS zone where the action should take place.

enabled:
  True if the record is enabled. If the record is disabled the value is false

name:
  (required) The name of the DNS record. Can either be partially or fully qualified.

provider:
  (required) Definition of the Micetro API provider.
