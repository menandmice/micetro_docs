Import DNS Records
==================

DNS Records can be imported in the Micetro Web Application.

Prerequisites
-------------

The user importing must have access to edit records in the zones used in the import.

See :ref:`access-control` for further information on access controls.

Import task
-----------

The action to import DNS Records is available from the :menuselection:`Actions` menu in the DNS zones list, that allows importing records to different zones at the same time.

:menuselection:`Actions --> Import DNS Records` is also available from within a specific zone, which allows importing records to that zone only.

DNS bulk import format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
  When choosing files, only plaintext CSV/TSV/TXT files are accepted. Excel spreadsheets need to be exported to one of these formats prior to importing.

Header line
"""""""""""

The first line of the data must be the header line, containing the name of the fields in the corresponding columns of the lines after it. Some of the fields refer to built-in system fields, while the rest of the fields are matching the custom properties that are defined for the object type in question.

.. tip::
  It's only necessary to include the fields that need to be imported/updated, except for properties that are defined as mandatory, or required to be able to identify the object to import.

The field names in the header line are not case sensitive. For example, "title" will be correlated to the custom property "Title".

Built-in fields
