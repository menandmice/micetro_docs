Quick command
=============

Introduction
------------

Quick Command is a feature to speed up common operations in the Web Application. It allows users to quickly find and perform actions on specific objects in the system, using a single, persistent dialog box.

The autocomplete functionality in the interface allows typing in either names or the addresses and dynamically presents the user options to choose from.

After selecting an object such as a DNS zone or a DNS record, the user can choose from a list of actions, for example Open, Edit, Delete, Reveal.

Using Quick Command
-------------------

The quick commands can be accessed by clicking either the lightning icon in the top menu or by using a keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl** + **Space**.
