Viewing Object Change History
=============================
You can access and navigate all changes made to any object in Micetro. The object change history provides a detailed log of all modifications made to any object, including timestamps, user information, actions taken, and user-entered comments.

**Permissions:** 

* Permission: ``Access to view history`` on Micetro.
* Role: ``Administrator (built-in)``

.. note::
   For information about how to view object change history in the Management Console, see  :ref:`console-object-change-history`.

All users can view their own object change history, while administrators have access to the history of all users.

You can view the history of a specific object or all objects.

**To view your own changes:**

1. Click the User icon in the upper-right corner.

2. Select :guilabel:`View history`.

**To view changes to a specific object:**

1. Select the object you want to view.

2. On the :guilabel:`Action` menu, select :guilabel:`View history`. You can also select this option on the Row :guilabel:`...` menu.

**To filter data in the Change History window:**

1. Click the filter icon in the top right corner.

You have the option to revert changes to DNS records and custom properties for all objects.

**To undo changes**:

1. Locate the specific action in the object history window that you want to undo, and click on the Row :guilabel:`...` menu associated with it.
