Split Range Wizard (Management Console, obsolete)
---------------------------------------------------

This wizard allows you to create multiple subranges of an existing range. The wizard can only be used on ranges that exist on subnet boundaries and have no subranges already in place.

1. From the object list, click on :guilabel:`IP Address Ranges`.

2. From the list of ranges displayed right-click and, from the shortcut menu, select :guilabel:`Split into Subranges`. The *Split range wizard* displays.

3. For each of the resulting screens, make a selection/entry and move through the wizard.
