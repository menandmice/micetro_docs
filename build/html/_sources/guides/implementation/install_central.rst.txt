It also serves as the meta-data storage engine, containing data such as zone history logs, user accounts and permissions, etc. You must have at least one copy of Central installed in the environment. Central does not need to be installed on a DNS server.

  "Men&Mice Central daemon", "mmcentrald, usually in /usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin"

  "Update directory", "update, located in the data directory"

.. note:: Running Men&Mice Central under a privileged user account
  Running Central as a specific service account affects a few functions when it talks to the Active Directory, such as Integrated Security communications with an SQL server database, communications with AD Sites and Services, authentication of AD users, and ability to ping.

  When creating a service account for Central, make sure the user is in the local "administrators" group on the Central machine. Otherwise it will not be able to utilize the ping functionality.

  The service account running Central needs to be added to the DNS Admins and/or DHCP Admins group to manage data.

.. important::
  The installer creates the data directories for Men&Mice Central at the default location (C:\\Program Files\\Men and Mice\\Central) even if the installation target is on a different drive or path. See :ref:`config-files-windows`.
