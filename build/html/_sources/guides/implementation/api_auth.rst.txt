API Authentication methods
==========================

There a few options for authenticating against the M&M API:

* :ref:`api-login-command`

* :ref:`api-login-headers`

* :ref:`api-login-sso`

.. _api-login-command:

Login command
-------------

This method is available in all versions of M&M, and all the different flavors of the M&M API (SOAP/JSON-RPC/REST). In the REST API, this command is available via the URL commands/Login

The Login command takes in server (for the M&M Central server), user name, and password, and returns a session ID, which should then be used for all other API calls via their session parameter.

The Login command and its parameters is fully documented in the normal SOAP API documentation

.. note::
  Remember to configure HTTPS for the mmws and/or _mmwebext sites for this authentication method, since the username and password can easily be extracted for anyone listening in on the communication.

.. _api-login-headers:

Authorization Headers
---------------------

With the introduction of Men&Mice Web Services and the REST API in version 7.3, it's now also possible to authenticate via HTTP headers, by adding a Basic Authorization header, or with a Negotiate Authorization header, if the client supports it.

.. note::
  If AuthorizationMethods is not defined in the preference file mmWS will only accept basic authorization.

By using authorization headers for authentication, the Login command becomes unnecessary, and the session ID is not used. The "session" parameter for all the commands must be omitted, and not left blank.

With this authentication method, multiple M&M Web Service instances can be deployed and used simultaneously behind a load balancer to provide a redundancy that is transparent to the API client.

The session IDs, on the other hand, are only valid on the API endpoint (web service) they were created with. So when an API client that uses a session id gets redirected to another Web Service/API Endpoint, the client will get an error that the session id is invalid or expired, and then needs to login again to get a new session id before proceeding.

Basic Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Basic Authentication, simply include a HTTP header like:

.. code-block::

  Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l

where the last part is ``<user name>:<password>``, base64 encoded

For more information on Basic Authorization headers on the client side, see for example here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

The authorization header authentication method is only available for JSON-RPC and REST APIs, and only if using M&M Web Services as an endpoint (i.e. the URL is <server>/mmws/api or <server>/mmws/json)

.. note::
  Remember to configure HTTPS for the mmws site for this authentication method since the username and password can easily be extracted for anyone listening in on the communication.

Negotiate Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Negotiate header Authorization (`SPNEGO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO)>`_-based Kerberos and NTLM HTTP Authentication) is also supported when the client supports it, and when it has been enabled for the Men&Mice Web Services.

This way, the user name and password are not provided in the header, and the API call is executed in the security context of the user that invokes it. In other words, this is the single sign-on authentication option that the Men&Mice Web Services provides.

To enable the Negotiate header Authorization in M&M Web Services, add the following line to the ``preferences.cfg``, and restart the ``mmws`` service.

.. code-block::

  <AuthorizationMethods value="Kerberos,NTLM" />

The order of the methods can be changed, e.g. if NTLM is preferred over Kerberos but in general if you don't want to allow NTLM (which is less secure) as a fallback only specify Kerberos as
a value.

.. _api-login-sso:

Single Sign-On
--------------

To enable single sign-on in the web application, make sure that Single Sign-on and Single Sign-on for web is enabled in Micetro. See :ref:`external-auth`.

..
  When using M&M Web Services as an API endpoint, refer to the Negotiate header Authorization section above.
  When using the M&M Web Extension that comes with the M&M Web Interface as an API endpoint, single sign-on is achieved by invoking a POST http request to
  .. code-block::
    http://<web server>/_mmwebext/mmwebext.dll?RequestSSO
  The body of the http request should include simply the M&M Central server name.
  If IIS is correctly configured (see :ref:`disable-kernel-mode-auth`), this request will return an XML similar to what the Login SOAP command would return:
  .. code-block:: XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
      <soap:Body>
          <LoginResponse xmlns="http://menandmice.com/webservices/">
              <session>UzL9uSNNcLjmlRx1PQsP</session>
              <userName>mydomain\myuser</userName>
          </LoginResponse>
      </soap:Body>
    </soap:Envelope>
  The *session* should then be used for all subsequent API commands.
