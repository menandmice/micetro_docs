Custom Properties
========================

As an administrator, you may find that it is necessary to create some custom properties. These properties are used for entry of any data that you feel is relevant for an object. For example, if you want to specify a server is in a specific location, or indicate who is responsible for a particular server, etc. Custom properties can be defined for various object types.

There are two Default Custom Properties built in to the Range object, Title and Description, which may not be changed.
