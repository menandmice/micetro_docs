Configuring DNS Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* In the Manage DHCP Options dialog box, click the :guilabel:`DNS` tab.

Enable DNS dynamic updates according to the settings below.
  Specifies whether the DHCP server sends DNS dynamic record updates to the DNS server. Updates are sent to DNS servers configured in TCP/IP client properties for any active network connections at the DHCP server.

  Dynamically update DNS A and PTR records.
    Specifies that the DHCP server update forward and reverse lookups are based on the type of request made by the client during the lease process.

  Always dynamically update DNS A and PTR records.
    Specifies that the DHCP server update forward and reverse DNS lookups when a client acquires a lease, regardless of the type of request used to acquire it.

Discard A and PTR records when lease is deleted.
  Specifies whether the DHCP server discards forward DNS lookups for clients when a lease expires.

Dynamically update DNS A and PTR records for DHCP clients.
  Specifies whether the DHCP server sends dynamic updates to the DNS server for DHCP clients that do not support performing these updates. If selected, clients running earlier versions of Windows are updated by the DHCP server for both their host (A) and pointer (PTR) resource records.

Disable dynamic updates for DNS PTR records

 * **Conflict detection attempts**: Specifies the number of conflict detection attempts you want the DHCP server to make before it leases an address to a client.
 * **Audit log file path**: Specifies the location of the DHCP server audit log files.
 * **Database path**: Specifies the location of the DHCP server database.
 * **Backup path**: Specifies the location for the database backup.


Toggling DHCPv6 Management On and Off
--------------------------------------
.. note::
   There is only one DHCP service on a Microsoft DHCP server. DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 are not decoupled in Microsoft as they are in Micetro. Any action performed on either DHCPv6 or DHCPv4 that requires a restart of the service will result in a restart of the single DHCP service on the Microsoft server.
   
1. On the **Admin** page, select the relevant Microsoft DHCP server.

2. On the :guilabel:`Action` menu, select :guilabel:`Edit service`. You can also select this option on the **Row menu (...)**. 

3. Select :guilabel:`Manage DHCPv6 service` to enable DHCPv6 management on the server(s) you selected.

4. Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

Reconciling Scopes
--------------------
The :guilabel:`Reconcile DHCP Scopes` option is used to fix inconsistencies between information in the registry and the DHCP database. For more information about how to reconcile MS DHCP servers, see :ref:`reconcile-scopes`.
