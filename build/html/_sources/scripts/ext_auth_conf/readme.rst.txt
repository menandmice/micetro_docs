The ext_auth_conf.json file within this folder is a template to be used for setting up external authentication (and multi-factor authentication, or MFA) with either Okta or Azure AD.

Depending on the external authentication vendor you choose, Okta or Azure AD, you will delete the other block for the other vendor. So, for example, if you're using Okta you must delete the Azure block and vice versa.
