Deployed in any on-premise, hybrid, or multicloud network environment, Micetro acts as a non-disruptive overlay that unifies server management under a single GUI and API. Micetro is a modular, software-defined DDI solution built around a number of components, and accessed through a unified user interface and API.

This documentation is divided into four parts:

1. :ref:`implementation`
2. :ref:`manual-introduction`
3. :ref:`admin-overview`
4. :ref:`reference`

Use the :ref:`implementation` to familiarize yourself with Micetro's architecture and installation procedures for components on different platforms. The :ref:`manual-introduction` covers all of Micetro's functionality. :ref:`admin-overview` is aimed at system administrators managing Micetro.
