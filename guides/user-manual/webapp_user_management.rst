Users
=====

Each user defined in Micetro can be a part of one or more groups. Before creating a user, it is recommended to define different groups so you can assign users directly to the desired group as you create their accounts.

.. note::
  "administrator" is the user already configured for the application. In order to manage users, you have to be logged in as a user who has user management privileges.

Adding User Accounts
--------------------

Through this function, you add new users who can then be assigned to groups.

1. Navigate to :menuselection:`Admin --> Configuration` and select :guilabel:`Users` in the filtering sidebar. The default administrator account displays here, as well as any other users you have already added.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Create` button. The *Create user* dialog box displays.

  Name
    Type the **username** that you want to as assign to this person.

  .. warning::
    Once you have created the user name, it is not possible to change it.

  Full Name and Description
    (Optional) Type the user's first and last name and a description of their duties (i.e., job title, department, etc.), respectively.

  Authentication type
    Click the drop-down list and specify whether the user's login will be authenticated by Micetro or by an external authentication service (such as existing Active Directory account on the network).

  Email address
    The user's email address. Used for sending notifications such as scheduled reports, subnet monitoring updates, etc.

  Password/Confirm Password
    If the **Authentication type** selected is *Men&Mice internal*, you need to provide a password for the user in the Password field. Passwords must be at least four characters in length and no longer than 20 characters. Passwords can contain any combination of letters and numbers, but cannot include spaces or special characters. In the Confirm Password field, re-enter the password exactly as you did in the Password field above.

  In the :guilabel:`Groups` and :guilabel:`Roles` tabs, select the user group(s) and role(s) to which you want to assign this user.
    Each user can be assigned to none or to multiple groups and roles. There are five default groups defined in Men&Mice Suite:

      * **Administrators**. Full access to everything.
      * **DNS Administrators**. Full access to all DNS related objects, such as zones, DNS servers, etc.
      * **DHCP Administrators**. Full access to DHCP related objects, including DHCP scopes, DHCP servers, etc.
      * **IPAM Administrators**. Full access to IPAM related objects, including IPAM ranges, etc.
      * **Users Administrators**. Full access to User and Group objects.

  .. note::
    If you have not created your groups, you can always come back and edit the user accounts anytime and change the group assignments.
