Edit DHCP Server Name (Management Console)
------------------------------------------

This feature allows you to change the name or IP Address used to connect to a DHCP server. This is useful if you need to refer to the server by another name or if you are connecting to the server by an IP Address and the IP Address has changed. You can also use this feature to change the connection method for MS DHCP servers.

To access this feature, do the following:

1. Locate the DHCP server.

2. Right-click and, from the shortcut menu, select :guilabel:`Edit Server Name`. The *Edit Server* name dialog box displays.

3. Change the **Server name**, **Server address** (optional), and **Server Type**. If applicable, you can select :guilabel:`Use proxy server` and enter the relevant information.

4. Click :guilabel:`OK`.
