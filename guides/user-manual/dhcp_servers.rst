DHCP Servers
=============

Micetro's :ref:`access control` system provides granular control over who can access DHCP information. You need administrative privileges on the DHCP service (`DHCP Administrators`) to access DHCP objects. 

To grant other roles access to DHCP information, make sure that they include the following permissions:

* **Access IPAM module**
* **List (or view) DHCP server**
* **List (or view) range**

.. note::
   To fully manage ..., additional permissions may be required, and specific access might be defined on individual ....
