  Dynamically update DNS A and PTR records.
    Specifies that the DHCP server update forward and reverse lookups are based on the type of request made by the client during the lease process.

  Always dynamically update DNS A and PTR records.
    Specifies that the DHCP server update forward and reverse DNS lookups when a client acquires a lease, regardless of the type of request used to acquire it.

Discard A and PTR records when lease is deleted.
  Specifies whether the DHCP server discards forward DNS lookups for clients when a lease expires.

Dynamically update DNS A and PTR records for DHCP clients.
  Specifies whether the DHCP server sends dynamic updates to the DNS server for DHCP clients that do not support performing these updates. If selected, clients running earlier versions of Windows are updated by the DHCP server for both their host (A) and pointer (PTR) resource records.
