Disable/Enable Records
----------------------

You can disable a record without deleting it. The disabled record performs no function; however, it can be instantly enabled when its services are needed, without having to re-type the record.

.. note::
  You cannot disable and enable records in dynamic zones.

How to Disable a Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. In the Zone window, select the record(s) that you want to disable. To select more than one record, hold down the Ctrl key while making your selections.

2. Right-click anywhere in the zone window and select :guilabel:`Disable Record`. Disabled records are grayed out in the Zone window.

3. In the toolbar, click the :guilabel:`Save` button to save the changes to the zone.

4. Select the disabled record(s) that you want to re-activate. To select multiple records at once, hold down the Ctrl key while making your selections.

5. Right-click anywhere in the zone window and select :guilabel:`Enable Record`.

6. In the toolbar, click the :guilabel:`Save` button to save the changes to the zone.
