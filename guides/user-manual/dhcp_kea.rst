ISC Kea DHCP
============

.. danger::
  Starting with Micetro 10.0, older versions of the Kea DHCP server are no longer supported. See :ref:`system-requirements` for a list of supported versions. You need to remove your existing (older) Kea DHCP servers from the system, and update them to a supported version of Kea before updating to Micetro 10.0 from an older version of the Men&Mice Suite. Not doing so could result in lost access to and data from the older Kea servers in Micetro.

.. _kea-control-agent:

Kea Control Agent
-----------------

The Kea Control Agent is a daemon that exposes a RESTful control interface for managing Kea servers. The Control Agent daemon can receive control commands over HTTP and either forward these commands to the respective Kea servers or handle them commands on its own.

.. note::
  The default port for the Kea Control Agent is ``8000``.

Because of the Kea Control Agent, Kea DHCP servers can be added to Micetro without a DHCP Server Controller running on every machine that runs Kea. A *single* DHCP Server Controller, installed on a machine that can access the instances that run Kea services, is sufficient and will communicate with all Kea servers on Micetro's behalf.

.. _add-kea-hooks:

Adding Kea to Micetro
---------------------

Because Micetro uses the Kea API to communicate with the DHCP server(s), it requires (in addition to the DHCP Server Controller) the Kea hook library ``libdhcp_lease_cmds.so``.

.. note::
  On certain distributions (like RHEL) check that the kea-hooks package is also installed.

Configuring the Kea hook library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing the Kea hook library, open ``kea-dhcp4.conf`` and locate the ``hooks-libraries`` array. Add the hook to ``libdhcp_lease_cmds.so``:

.. code-block::
  :linenos:

  "hooks-libraries":[
      {
        "library" : "/lib64/kea/hooks/libdhcp_lease_cmds.so",
        "parameters" : {}
      }
  ]

The location of the library depends on your distribution, use ``whereis libdhcp_lease_cmds.so`` to find it.

After adding the library, restart Kea and the Kea Control Agent.

Kea high availability
---------------------

Kea DHCP servers need to be configured for high availability **before** the primary server is added to Micetro. If the high availability is set up properly, once added to the system Micetro will recognize the failover nodes and the method (load balancing, hot standby, etc.) and configure the server objects accordingly.

For more information, see :ref:`dhcp-kea-ha`.

Split scopes in load balancing mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating scopes on Kea servers configured in load balancing mode for high availability, Micetro will split the available pool evenly between primary and secondary servers.
