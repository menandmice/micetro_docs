Health Monitoring Bar
---------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Men&Mice Health Monitoring provides the administrator with valuable information he needs to maintain his systems and services. First, a good overview of the general health of Micetro and related services. More importantly, it will give the administrator an indication if there is a problem that needs to be acted on and corrected, for example if there is a slave zone that is expiring or if there is a zone that has not been loaded on a server due to an error. Both cases can cause outages for users and therefore be a serious impact for the business.

Categories
^^^^^^^^^^

The health status is displayed to the user from the health bar which is positioned at the bottom of the management console window. The status indicators are split into five categories

* Micetro

* DNS

* DHCP

* IPAM

* Appliance

A color code is used to represent the severity of the error. If an indicator in any of those categories has a warning or error, it is shown as yellow or red, respectively; otherwise as green. The health bar can be expanded and then the indicator subcategories are shown and more details can be obtained about the health indicators. More importantly, details about each error are given in a separate window where a detailed description about the error is given and also the administrator is given the opportunity to navigate to the object that is affected and from there, fix the error.
