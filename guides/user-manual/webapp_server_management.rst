Server management
=================

Managing DNS and DHCP servers in the system is done by navigating to :guilabel:`Admin`.

A list of all servers configured in the system is shown by default.

In the left sidebar it is possible to choose from viewing DNS servers, DHCP servers, or Appliances (if configured in the system).

In the right hand sidebar, the properties of a selected server is shown. Any custom fields defined will also be displayed there.

Server Management actions
-------------------------

Any actions that can be performed on a selected server can either be accessed in the :guilabel:`Actions` above the list or by hovering over a menu at the right hand side of the list.
