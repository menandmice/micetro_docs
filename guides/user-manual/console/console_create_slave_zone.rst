Slave Server Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following procedure to assign a slave server to a particular zone so it will always work from the context of the zone.

1. In the Object Section, under :guilabel:`DNS Servers`, select the name server containing the zone to which you want to assign a slave server.

2. In the Object List, right-click on the zone to which you want to assign the slave server.

3. From the shortcut menu, select :guilabel:`Add slave server`.

4. Choose the desired slave server from the submenu that displays. That zone now displays as a slave on the server that was specified.
