The user importing must have the following permissions:

* Access to DNS Module

* Access to the Web Application

The action to import DNS Records is available from the :menuselection:`Actions` menu in the DNS zones list, that allows importing records to different zones at the same time.

:menuselection:`Actions --> Import DNS Records` is also available from within a specific zone, which allows importing records to that zone only.
