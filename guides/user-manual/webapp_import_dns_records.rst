Import DNS Records
==================

Overview
--------

DNS Records can be imported in the Micetro Web Application. The action to import DNS Records is available from the :menuselection:`Actions` menu in the DNS zones list, that allows importing records to different zones at the same time.

:menuselection:`Actions --> Import DNS Records` is also available from within a specific zone, which allows importing records to that zone only.
