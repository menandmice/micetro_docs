Import DNS Records
==================

DNS Records can be imported in the Micetro Web Application.

Prerequisites
-------------

The user importing must have the following permissions:

* Access to DNS Module

* Access to the Web Application

* Access to Advanced Zone view in Web Application

* Access to "Import Data" web task

In addition, the user doing the import needs to have access to edit records in the zones used in the import.

See :ref:`global-access` for further information on access controls.

Import task
-----------

The action to import DNS Records is available from the :menuselection:`Actions` menu in the DNS zones list, that allows importing records to different zones at the same time.

:menuselection:`Actions --> Import DNS Records` is also available from within a specific zone, which allows importing records to that zone only.
