Managing Groups/Hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Allows you to manage groups and hosts within groups on an ISC DHCP server. You can also manage host entries that are defined in the global scope.

To manage groups and hosts, do the following:

1. Select the ISC DHCP server for which you want to manage groups and/or hosts.

2. Right-click on the server and, from the shortcut menu, select :guilabel:`Manage Groups and Hosts`. A new menu displays in the menu bar and the *DHCP Groups* dialog box displays.

.. _console-dhcp-isc-subclasses:

Editing Subclasses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Allows you to edit subclasses on an ISC DHCP server.

.. note::
  You cannot manage DHCP classes â€“ only subclasses of existing DHCP classes.

To edit subclasses, do the following:

1. Select the ISC DHCP server for which you want to edit subclasses.

2. Right-click on the server and, from the shortcut menu, select :guilabel:`Edit Subclasses`. The *DHCP class* dialog box displays.

3. Choose a class to edit and click the :guilabel:`Select` button. A new dialog box displays where you can enter the client identifiers or MAC addresses of the hosts that should belong to the selected class.

4. The dialog box contains a multi-line edit field where you can quickly add multiple entries. NOTE: When entering MAC addresses you **must** use a *colon* (,) as a separator. Each line in the dialog box should contain one entry. To delete an entry, simply remove the corresponding line in the dialog box.

5. Click :guilabel:`OK` to confirm your changes and close the dialog box.

.. _console-dhcp-isc-define-options:

Defining Options on ISC DHCP Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. In the Object List, right-click on the applicable DHCP Server and, from the shortcut menu, select :guilabel:`Define Options`. The *DHCP Server Option* definition dialog box displays. The dialog box shows all custom options defined on the DHCP server. The standard ISC DHCP options will reside in the Standard Vendor class. Other custom class that have been added will be available in the Vendor class drop down field.

2. To Add an option, click the :guilabel:`+` button at the end of the option list. Enter the ID, name and type of data to use for the option. The several data types can be specified as arrays and the Array checkbox is enabled when a supported data type is selected. To specify an array, click the Array checkbox.

3. To Delete an option, click the :guilabel:`-` button next to the option you want to delete.

4. To change the ID for an option, enter the new ID in the **ID** field.

.. note::
  You can only edit the ID property for existing options.

5. Click :guilabel:`OK` to save the option definition.
