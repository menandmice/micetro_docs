Edit Preferred Servers (Management Console)
-------------------------------------------

This option is only available when working with AD integrated zones. (See :ref:`active-directory`.) It is used to specify the server to use when opening an AD integrated zone.

It is also possible to specify which server to use if the preferred server becomes unavailable—e.g., the server on the top of the list is tried first and, if that server is unavailable, the second server is tried, and so on.

1. From the menu bar, select :menuselection:`Zone --> Preferred Server`. The *Edit preferred server list* dialog box displays.

2. Change the order of your servers into the preferred order.

3. Click :guilabel:`OK`.
