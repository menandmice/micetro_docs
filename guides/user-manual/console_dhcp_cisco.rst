Adding a Cisco DHCP server
==========================

When adding a Cisco DHCP server, the following dialog box displays:

  :width: 60%
  :align: center

Type the **User name** and **Password** that should be used to access the server. This is the user name and password that is used when normally accessing the Cisco device from the command line prompt. If the server requires a separate password to enter privilege level 15, enter the required password in the **Enable Password** field. If you select the :guilabel:`Connect using Secure Shell (SSHv2)` checkbox, a secure connection will be used to access the server. If this checkbox is unchecked, the server will be accessed through a telnet connection.

Set User Name and Password

This menu item is only displayed when a user with DHCP administration privileges is logged in. This command updates the user name and password that should be used to access the Cisco DHCP server. Use this command if the user name or password on the Cisco DHCP server has changed.
