Filtering sidebar
=================

Overview
--------

The filtering sidebar acts as a selector in each context, and allows users to quickly find the zones or networks. Users can select pre-defined “filters” or selectors (shown in the image on the right, and described in tables below for other contexts in the system).

The sidebar is open (displaying icon and text) by default, but can be collapsed to an icon-only mode. In case where a list of clickable items is needed the sidebar is automatically unfolded.

Selecting an item in the filtering sidebar applies the filter for the main work grid. Users can further narrow down results with quickfilters from the top menu. (See :ref:`webapp-quick-filter`.)

.. tip::
  When you select a filter in the filtering sidebar, and then use the :guilabel:`Create` operation in the grid, the type of object will be automatically selected based on the active filter.

These are a set of common filters available in all sections for the Web Application.
