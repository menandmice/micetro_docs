Working with the list view
--------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The web application is centered around the grid listing objects in the system. (For example: DNS zones, DNS records, IP address ranges, DHCP scopes, IP addresses, etc.)

  "Main tasks", "The main tasks in each section. All available tasks are shown at the top of the Inspector"
  "Inspector", "Shows various information for each selected item in the list. See :ref:`webapp-inspector`."
  "Filtering sidebar", "Shows a list of possible filters to use for the list. See :ref:`webapp-filtering`."
  "Quick command", "Allows for quickly finding and performing actions. See :ref:`webapp-quick-command`."

Folders
^^^^^^^

Folders can be used as containers of objects such as DNS zones and networks.

.. note::
  Currently the Web Application does not support managing folders (creating, editing, deleting), which needs to be done through the Management Console. See :ref:`object-folders` for further information.

The available folders, along with the folder hierarchy can be viewed in the filtering sidebar. Clicking on a folder will display the contents of the specific folder.

Selecting an item in the list and running the "Set folder" task from the Actions, will display a dialog where the item can be moved from one folder to another or removed from a folder.

Selecting multiple items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selecting multiple items in the list can be done by:

* On Windows: holding down the CTRL or SHIFT button and selecting rows with the mouse

* On OS X: holding down the CMD button and selecting rows with the mouse

Results
^^^^^^^

In the list's footer, the number of results is shown:

The top menu allows to switch between the three main sections of the Web Application (DNS, Networks, and Reporting). Additionally, the Quick commands, User Management, and Help is accessible.

Navigating
^^^^^^^^^^

The navigation bar at the top of the grid interface

* indicates where you are

* allows you to navigate between subsections

You can also quickly check your current location by glancing at the breadcrumbs at the bottom of the interface.

.. _webapp-object-change-history:

History
-------

The history for the following objects is made available as a task (in the inspector actions) as well as a Quick Command.

* DNS zones

* DNS records

* IP address ranges

Save comments
-------------

For audit trail purposes, saving comments is required after making changes in the system.

After making a change, the following dialog is displayed where users can write a comment that will be included in the history for that object.

.. _webapp-time-and-date:

Date and time handling
----------------------

In certain places like scheduling a change in Workflow and scheduling a report generation in Reporting, the date and times must be in the same time zone as the Men&Mice Central uses.
