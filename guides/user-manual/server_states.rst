Server states 
-------------

On the :menuselection:`Admin --> Server management` page Micetro displays an indicator of the state of the individual servers configured in the system.

    :width: 80%
    :align: center 

The indicators can refer to either the Server Controller (see :ref:`install-controllers`) running on the DNS/DHCP server, or the DNS/DHCP server service itself. 

Use the following table for more information on the indicators:
