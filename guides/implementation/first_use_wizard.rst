First use wizard
----------------

When connecting the Management Console to a newly installed instance of Men&Mice Central, or if this is the first time logging in, you are presented with the First Use Wizard.

The ‘First use wizard’ guides the administrator through configuring the system and make it ready to accept connections from the Controllers(s) and the Web Application. After the wizard completes, you’re presented with the main view of the Console.

.. note::
  The Web Application is designated to carry out all daily tasks in your network environments. The Management Console is to be used only for advanced management operations and administration tasks. See :ref:`advanced-config`.
