Micetro Agents
===============

Micetro uses agents, also known as server controllers, to handle communication between Micetro and the external service. Depending on the type of service and whether it is located on-premises or cloud, the agent is installed on the respective machine, the machine running Micetro central or, in some cases, any machine within the same domain as the DNS/DHCP servers. A single agent can handle communication with multiple servers.

  The installer was designed to be quick and straightforward. Pay attention to the steps, if you would like to customize your installation, such as installing Central to a different path.

  Servers in Active Directory environments can be connected without using an agent. For more information, see :ref:`ms-agent-free` in *Agent-free management of DNS/DHCP servers*.
