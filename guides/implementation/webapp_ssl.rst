Setup SSL for the Web Application
=================================

SSL on Linux (Apache)
---------------------

By default, the Web Application uses unencrypted http connection on port 80. To use it with https on port 443, follow these steps.

Check that mod_ssl for Apache is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

  yum install mod_ssl

If you have existing SSL key files: place the .key file in /etc/pki/tls/private/ and the .crt and .csr files in /etc/pki/tls/certs/.

If you need new SSL keys, generate a keypair:

.. code-block:: bash

  openssl req -new -nodes -keyout mmweb.key -out mmweb.csr -newkey rsa:4096

Create self-signed certificate:

.. code-block:: bash

  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in mmweb.csr -signkey mmweb.key -out externaldns3.crt

Place the files in the appropriate directories:

.. code-block:: bash
  :linenos:

  cp mmweb.key /etc/pki/tls/private/
  cp mmweb.c* /etc/pki/tls/certs/

Once the keyfiles are placed in their respective directories, edit the mmweb.conf file in the Apache configuration directory (default /etc/httpd/conf, or use find /etc/ -name "mmweb.conf" to locate the file) with the following changes:

* change ``<VirtualHost *:80>`` to ``<VirtualHost *:443>``
* add in the references to the key files (amend the path as necessary):

.. code-block::
  :linenos:

  SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/mmweb.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/mmweb.key

* enable SSL:

.. code-block::
  :linenos:

    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH:3DES:!aNULL:!MD5:!SEED:!IDEA

.. note::
  The default Apache installation may already have a ``<VirtualHost _default_:443>`` directive, which can conflict with the ``mmweb.conf`` file.
  Comment out this existing VirtualHost block to prevent any errors.

To verify the Web Application is accessible, navigate to ``https://web-application.domain.tld``. The Men&Mice Web Applicationâ€™s login panel should appear.

SSL on Windows (IIS)
--------------------

Configuring SSL Certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the IIS (Internet Information Services) Manager

Select the :guilabel:`Web Server node` in the left sidebar, under "Start Page", and double click on :guilabel:`Server Certificates` in the middle pane

.. image:: ../../images/iis-ssl-step1.png
  :width: 90%
  :align: center

Choose one of the actions in the actions sidebar on the left to import an existing .pfx SSL certificate, or create a self-signed certificate. If your certificate is in a different format than .pfx, please refer to documentation and/or tools that certificate authorities typically provide to convert their certificates to Microsoft's .pfx format

Select your website under *Sites* in the left sidebar (usually Default Web Site) , and click :guilabel:`Bindings...` in the **Actions** sidebar on the right.

.. image:: ../../images/iis-ssl-step2.png
  :width: 90%
  :align: center

In the *Site Bindings* dialog that opened, click :guilabel:`Add`, select **https** from the *Type* menu, and then select the certificate added in step 3 in the SSL certificate picklist. Then click :guilabel:`OK`.

The "Host Name" and "Require Server Name Indication" can be left blank if this the first certificate installed on the server.

Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Editing web.config
""""""""""""""""""

Locate and open the web.config file for your Default Website in notepad. This is typically at C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config

Add the following rule xml to the rewrite > rules section of the xml, at the top below <clear />

.. code-block::
  :linenos:

  <rule name="HTTP to HTTPS redirect" enabled="true" stopProcessing="true">
      <match url="(.*)" />
      <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="false">
          <add input="{HTTPS}" pattern="^OFF$" />
      </conditions>
      <action type="Redirect" url="https://{HTTP_HOST}/{R:1}" appendQueryString="true" redirectType="Permanent" />
  </rule>

In the IIS manager, select the :guilabel:`Default Web site`, right click, and select :menuselection:`Manage Website --> Restart` to make the changes to the web.config take effect.

  :align: center

With *Default Web Site* selected in the left sidebar, double click on :guilabel:`URL Rewrite` in the middle pane. Verify the rule *HTTP to HTTPS redirect* is at the top of the rewrite rules

Using the IIS manager
"""""""""""""""""""""

With **Default Web Site** selected in the left sidebar, double click on :guilabel:`URL Rewrite` in the middle pane

If there's a *HTTP to HTTPS redirect* rule already in place at the top of the list of URL rewrite rules, nothing needs to be done.

Click :guilabel:`Add Rules` in the **Actions** pane on the right, and click OK to create a blank inbound rule.

In the name field enter *HTTP to HTTPS redirect*.

In Pattern field enter ``(.*)``

Under conditions click :guilabel:`Add` and enter the following condition:

.. image:: ../../images/iis-ssl-step5.png
  :width: 60%
  :align: center

In the **Action** pane on the bottom, choose *Redirect* from the :guilabel:`Action type` dropdown, and set redirect URL to ``https://{HTTP_HOST}/{R:1}`` and the redirect type to *Permanent (301)*.

.. image:: ../../images/iis-ssl-step6.png
  :width: 70%
  :align: center

Click :guilabel:`Apply` in the **Actions** pane on the left. And click :guilabel:`Back to rules`.

Move the new *HTTP to HTTPS redirect* rule to the top of the rules using the :guilabel:`Move Up` button in the action pane on the right.
