"""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. First, download the OVA file (http://appliance.is/caching.ova) or use http://download.menandmice.com/Appliance/ for a specific version

2. To setup the Virtual Appliance in VMWare Fusion, either double click the OVA file, or navigate to :guilabel:`File` and select :guilabel:`Import`.

3. A dialog box appears that will allow you to specify the location of the OVA file. Confirm by clicking the :guilabel:`Open` button.

4. After specifying the name of the new virtual appliance, clicking :guilabel:`Import` will finalize the importing of the virtual appliance.

5. The Virtual Appliance is now ready to be started up.

VMWare ESX/ESXi
