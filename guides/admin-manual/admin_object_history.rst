Viewing Global Object History
=============================
The **Logging** tab of the **Admin** page shows the global object history and log messages generated by Micetro. The global object history allows you to track changes made to various objects, providing valuable insights into the date, time, user, client, actions taken, and any comments associated with each modification.

.. note::
  This information applies to the Micetro web interface. For information about change history in the M&M Management Console, see :ref:`console-object-change-history`.
  
**Permission:** 

* Permission: ``Access to view history`` on Micetro
* Role: ``Administrators (built-in)``

**To view global object history**:

1. On the **Admin** page, select the :guilabel:`Logging` tab. 

2. Select :guilabel:`Object History` in the filtering sidebar.

3. Use the search options to filter the results.

  * When searching for a change log, narrow down your search by selecting the desired :guilabel:`Object type` for more focused results. 
  * Use  :guilabel:`Made by user` to view changes made by a specific user.
   
Undoing Changes
----------------
You have the option to revert changes to DNS records and custom properties for all objects. 

**To undo changes**:

1. Locate the specific action in the object history log that you want to undo and click on the Row :guilabel:`...` menu associated with it.

2. Select :guilabel:`Undo`.
