The System Settings include the following categories:

  * :ref:`admin-general`

  * :ref:`admin-authentication`

  * :ref:`admin-logging`

  * :ref:`admin-error-checking`

  * :ref:`admin-dns`

  * :ref:`admin-ipam`

  * :ref:`admin-monitoring`

  * :ref:`admin-advanced`
  

.. _admin-general:

General
-------
Use the General settings to specify the following:

  * Save Comments for Micetro.

  * Settings for AD Sites and Subnets integration.

  * Rules to determine when an IP address is considered as being in use.

Save Comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, users can save changes in the system without writing a comment. Here you have the option to set the comment requirements for Micetro tasks, including options to turn off the save comment dialog box, make it optional, or require it. 

   * When **off** is selected, the save comment dialog box will not appear when users save changes. 
   * If you choose to make comments **optional**, users can choose whether or not to include a comment when saving changes.
   * If you choose to make comments **required**, users will need to include a comment whenever they save changes.

AD Sites and Subnets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enable AD sites and subnets integration
  When selected, all AD sites and their corresponding subnets will be displayed in Micetro, and you can add and remove subnets from sites and move subnets between different sites as needed. AD sites and subnets will be listed on the **AD Sites** menu on the IPAM page.
  
  If you want to synchronize the  Location  and  Description  fields of the subnets in Active Directory with custom properties in Micetro, choose the desired custom properties to synchronize against. When synchronization is active, any changes made to the fields in Active Directory will automatically update the corresponding fields in Micetro, and vice versa. See :ref:`active-directory`.

Enforce AD site inheritance.
  Select this checkbox if you want to enforce site inheritance in AD. When site inheritance is enforced, child subnets must reside in the same site as the parent subnet. If site inheritance is not enforced, child subnets can be placed in different sites than the parent subnet. See :ref:`active-directory`.

Determine Address Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Control how IP addresses are identified as being in use. By default, these settings are all selected. To specify which rules should be applied to IP addresses and get a more granular picture of where the usage is coming from, select/clear the appropriate checkboxes.

.. _admin-authentication:

Authentication
--------------
Configure authentication methods, including single sign-on, LDAP integration, and external login providers. 

When **single sign-on** is activated, users do not have to authenticate when logging in to Micetro. For more information about Single sign-on, see :ref:`webapp-external-auth`.

External Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow users to log in to Micetro using credentials from Okta or Azure AD. The :guilabel:`Configure` button opens a form where you can set enter the necessary information needed for Okta or Azure AD authentication. 

Decide how login options appear on the Micetro login page.

Validate signature of external authentication script before running
  This feature only has an effect when single sign-on is enabled. It ensures the security of the authentication process by confirming the authenticity of external authentication scripts before executing them.

.. _admin-logging:

Logging
-------
The Logging settings allow you to specify when log messages should be deleted and whether lease history for DHCP servers should be collected.

Micetro Log
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Logging level for Micetro Central (1-6)
   Determines the level of detail to log when logging the output of Micetro Central to a file.

Log file for Micetro Central
   Specifies the path and name of the log file to use when you want to log the output of Micetro Central to a file.

Purge log message after (# of days)
  Enter the number of days the logs should be kept before they are deleted.

Log extra information when address collection is triggered
  When selected, information about the start and duration of the address collection is written in the Micetro log file.

Lease History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you can select to start collecting lease history for DHCP servers. By viewing the DHCP lease history, you can quickly identify any potential issues or conflicts.
  
You can specify the number of days to keep the history before it is deleted, and if you want to save the history to a comma separated text file before it is deleted, enter a name for the file in the **Flush lease history to file before purging** text box.

.. _admin-error-checking:

Error Checking
--------------
In this section you can specify how the system reports certain errors related to DNS.

Stop A/AAAA records from being created if the name already exists
  This setting prevents the creation of A/AAAA records when a name already exists in the system. This can be useful for avoiding conflicts or overwriting existing records in the DNS configuration.

Ignore missing reverse zones.
  An error message displays when Micetro is unable to update a reverse record for a changed address record. It is possible to suppress this error message if no reverse zone exists for the given address record by selecting this checkbox.

.. _admin-dns:

DNS
---
Use these settings to specify various DNS related settings. 

Delegation Records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When activated, Micetro will automatically create delegation records (NS records) in the corresponding parent zones whenever subzones are created. This ensures that the delegation chain between parent and subzones is maintained correctly.

Adjust Zone Transfer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow Micetro to automatically adjust zone transfer settings on Microsoft DNS servers to enable management of dynamic and Active Directory integrated zones.

DNSSEC
^^^^^^
Include derived DNSSEC records when viewing DNSSEC signed zones in Micetro. Note that this will significantly increase the size of the Micetro database and may affect overall system performance.


.. _admin-ipam:

IPAM
----

Specify various IPAM related settings:

  * How the system should handle new subranges if the parent range is in a folder.

  * How the system should behave when naming conflicts between existing IP Address ranges and DHCP scopes occur.
    
  * How the system should behave if DHCP scopes are removed outside Micetro.

  * Whether the system should allow reservations inside address pools on ISC DHCP servers.

Subranges
   The selection made here determines what happens when a user creates a subrange of a range in a folder.

Name conflicts between ranges and scopes
  Specify what happens if the name of an MS DHCP scope does not match the name of an existing IP address range.

Apply same rule for scope description as for scope name above.
  When selected, the system will use the same rules to update scope description as it does for updating scope names.

Allow reservations inside pools on ISC DHCP servers.
  When selected, the system allows users to create reservations inside pools on ISC DHCP servers. When a reservation is created inside a pool, the pool is split to make space for the reservation.

  .. warning::
    If a reservation that has been created inside a pool is deleted, the address is not made a part of the pool again.

Allow allocation of IP addresses from IP Address Containers
  When selected, the system will allow allocation of IP addresses that reside in IP address Containers. For more information on IP address Containers,  refer to  :ref:`ipam-containers`.

Disable scanning of VRF information
   By default, the system does not scan for VRF information. If you clear the checkbox, the system will begin scanning for VRF information. If an overlap is found between different VRFs, the system will log the issue. 
   
Always show discovery info
   Determines whether the columns related to host discovery should always be displayed when viewing contents of subnets or scopes.


.. _admin-monitoring:

Monitoring
----------
Specify various monitoring related settings.

Subnet Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enable subnet monitoring
  When enabled, the system monitors the free addresses in DHCP address pools and subnets and performs an action if the number of free addresses goes below a user-definable threshold. For further configuration, see :ref:`admin-subnet-monitoring-events`.

  .. note::
    The global subnet monitoring setting can be overridden for individual subnets by changing the setting explicitly for the subnet. Refer to  IP Address Managementâ€”Subnet Monitoring and Utilization History  for information on how to change monitoring settings for individual subnets.
   
When subnet monitoring is enabled, a new column, Monitoring, displays when viewing the subnet list. To quickly see all subnets that are monitored, you can use the Quick Filter and filter by this column by entering "Monitor: Yes" in the Quick Filter search field.

  .. note::
    Only DHCP scopes that are enabled are monitored. Disabled scopes are ignored.

When subnet monitoring is enabled, you must specify the mail server and the sender e-mail address to use if you want the subnet monitor to send an e-mail. Place the appropriate information in the SMTP Server and Mail from fields.

Enable sending SNMP traps.
  When enabled, the system will send SNMP traps when certain events occur:

    * When the number of free IP Addresses in monitored subnets goes below a user-definable threshold.

    * When a log event of type Error or Notice occurs. Refer to :ref:`admin-logging` for more information on log events.

  When enabling sending of SNMP traps, you must provide additional information:

   * Manager name
      Enter the host name of the computer that should receive the SNMP traps.

   * Manager port
      Enter the port number the Manager uses for the SNMP traps.

   * Community
      Enter the community string (password) to use for the SNMP traps.

Service Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When selected, the monitoring tool monitors the DNS and DHCP services on their respective servers. Decide on an appropriate interval for monitoring.
