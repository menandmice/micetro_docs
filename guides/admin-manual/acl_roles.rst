Roles
-----

Through roles you can manage access control in Micetro.

Objects (servers, zones, scopes, IP addresses, etc.) in Micetro are accessed through :ref:`acl-roles` configured with :ref:`acl-permissions`. :ref:`acl-users` and :ref:`acl-groups` do not have direct access to objects, only if they're **assigned to roles**. Administrators can control a user or group's access by assigning or removing them from roles.

.. note::
    This page is for generic management of roles. See :ref:`acl-general-roles`, :ref:`acl-specific-roles`, and :ref:`acl-legacy-roles` for the particularities of the different role types.
