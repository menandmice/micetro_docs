Access Management
=================

.. important::
  Micetro 10.1 (released in September 2021) brought changes to the access management in order to make it more streamlined and easier to use, while keeping the flexibility. This page describes the new access control. If you're using an older version, or would like information on the legacy access control model, see :ref:`access-control-legacy`.

Overview
--------

Access control in Micetro is **role-based**.

Objects (servers, zones, scopes, IP addresses, etc.) in Micetro are accessed through :ref:`acl-roles` configured with :ref:`acl-permissions`. :ref:`acl-users` and :ref:`acl-groups` do not have direct access to objects, only if they're **assigned to roles**. Administrators can control a user or group's access by assigning or removing them from roles.

A set of :ref:`acl-built-in-roles` are available that should cover most use cases. These are :ref:`acl-general-roles`, applied to all objects (present and future) in Micetro. :ref:`acl-specific-roles` exist for use cases where per-object permissions are required.

Groups, Users, and Roles
------------------------

The relationship between :ref:`acl-groups`, :ref:`acl-users`, and :ref:`acl-roles` is as follows:

* Users and groups can be assigned to roles.

* Groups can contain users.

* Groups *cannot* contain groups.

* Users from externally managed groups, such as Active Directory, cannot be added to local groups.

* Users and groups can be assigned to any number of roles.

.. _administrator:

The ``administrator`` user
--------------------------

The built-in, local ``administrator`` user exists outside of regular access controls. All permissions are enabled for this user (even if not attached to any role) and its permissions cannot be edited or overriden (see :ref:`block-permission`) by any role.

The password for the ``administrator`` user is configured during the :ref:`first-run-wizard`.

The ``administrator`` user cannot be removed from Micetro, and is always local (cannot be authenticated by SSO).

New objects
-----------

When a user imports or creates a new object (such as DNS zone, record, DHCP scope, IPAM range, etc.) in Micetro, the object is configured for a certain default access based on the permissions for the object type. General roles configured with permissions for the object type will have automatic access to the object.


Access Control Management
-------------------------

Because Micetro's access controls are role-based, permissions are configured *on the role*, and propagated to any user or group attached to the role.

To grant restricted access on a per-object basis, see :ref:`acl-specific-roles`.

To check access to a specific object and troubleshoot access control issues, see :ref:`acl-effective-access`.
