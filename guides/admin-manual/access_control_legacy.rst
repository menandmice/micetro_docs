Access control (Legacy, pre-10.1)
=================================

The Micetro access model is object-based. This is similar to mainstream operating system access models such as the Windows Security model, where you choose an object and set access restrictions for particular Users, Groups or Roles for the chosen object. We define a set of object types, and a set of Access Flags for each object type. These flags can then be set to Allow or Deny for each User, Group or Role.

The relationship between Groups, Users and Roles is as follows:

* Groups can contain Users

* Groups cannot contain Groups

* Users can be a member of any number of Groups

* Users and Groups can be assigned to Roles.

Built-in Roles
--------------

.. note::
  Please note that in previous versions (< 6.7) roles did not exist and the built-in roles described below were previously built-in groups. All of the users that were members in specific built-in groups are now assigned to the corresponding built-in roles.

Five Roles are built-in to Micetro. These roles are special in that they get full access for their respective domains for all Access Flags.

When new objects are created, the Built-in Role that presides over that object, as well as the user or group that created the object, receives full access to it.

Each administrator role also receives default access to its corresponding module (including an Access Flag set on Micetro object allowing them administrator privileges for their domain). The Administrators role receives default access to all the Access Flags on Micetro object. Default access for each Built-in role is as follows:

* Administrators. Full access to all objects

* DNS Administrators. Full access to DNS objects, including zones, DNS servers, etc.

* DHCP Administrators. Full access to DHCP objects, including scopes, DHCP servers, etc.

* IPAM Administrators. Full access to IPAM objects, including IPAM ranges, etc.

* User Administrators. Full access to User and Group objects.

It is recommended that our clients use these Roles. These roles are the only roles that can receive default access to new items. User-defined Roles do not receive any access information for new objects and are considered to have "denied" access. To allow a User or a Group to receive default full access to a new object, include the User or Group as a member in the corresponding Built-in Role. If you need to reduce this particular User's access, refer to :ref:`access-overrde` section below.

When it's mentioned that a User or Group has Full access to an object we mean that the User or Group has all known Access Flags for the object set to Allow.

The Administrator User
----------------------

A single user is Built-in to Micetro. The Administrator User exists completely outside of the access model. This User can do everything, and it is not possible to deny any action to this User.

Examples:

The Micetro object will have the following access bits set to Allow for the DNS Administrators Role:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Access Flags", "Allow", "Deny"
  :widths: 20, 10, 10

  "Administer DNS servers", 1, 0
  "Access DNS Module", 1, 0

For every DNS server created, the server will have the following flags set to Allow for the DNS Administrators Role:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Access Flags", "Allow", "Deny"
  :widths: 20, 10, 10

  "Edit DNS Server access", 1, 0
  "List (or view) DNS Server", 1, 0
  "Edit DNS Server options", 1, 0
  "Add Master Zones", 1, 0
  "Add non-Master Zones", 1, 0
  "View DNS Server Log", 1, 0
  "Clear DNS Server Log", 1, 0
  "Edit DNS server properties", 1, 0

For every DNS Zone created, the zone will have these flags set to Allow for the DNS Administrators Role:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Access Flags", "Allow", "Deny"
  :widths: 20, 10, 10

  "Edit Zone access", 1, 0
  "List (or view) Zone", 1, 0
  "Enable/disable Zone", 1, 0
  "Edit Zone options", 1, 0
  "Delete Zone", 1, 0
  "Enable/disable apex records", 1, 0
  "Edit apex records", 1, 0
  "Enable/disable wildcard records", 1,	0
  "Edit wildcard records", 1, 0
  "Enable/disable other records", 1, 0
  "Edit other records", 1, 0
  "Edit zone properties", 1, 0

.. _access-override:

Overriding Access Settings
--------------------------

The Deny setting for an Access Flag allows you to override access settings inherited from Roles. A User's Access Footprint is calculated from the aggregate access settings of all Roles in which he is a member. In this calculation, the Deny flag overrides the Allow flag. This means that if a User is in several Roles where a specific Access Flag is set to Allow, and only a single Role where the same Access Flag is set to Deny, the result of the calculation for that Access Flag is Deny.

Let us take an example. Assume you want to add a new user that has DNS Administrator privileges to all servers and zones, but on a particular zone, this user should not be able to view or clear the history, nor should he be able to edit custom properties. To accomplish this, you would first include the new user in the Built-in Role named DNS Administrators.

To restrict the user for a particular zone you would locate the zone and set access for your new user to the following:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Access Flags", "Allow", "Deny"
  :widths: 20, 10, 10

  "Edit Zone access", 1, 0
  "List (or view) Zone", 1, 0
  "Enable/disable Zone", 1, 0
  "Edit Zone options", 1, 0
  "Delete Zone", 1, 0
  "Enable/disable apex records", 1, 0
  "Edit apex records", 1, 0
  "Enable/disable wildcard records", 1,	0
  "Edit wildcard records", 1,	0
  "Enable/disable other records", 1, 0
  "Edit other records", 1, 0
  "Edit zone properties", 0, 1

If you wanted to give similar access to other users, you could instead create a new Role, add the Users to the Role, and apply the aforementioned access to the zone in question for the new Role.

This system allows for a great deal of flexibility when designing your security. Any Role can be extended or overridden for a set of Users by simply adding the Users to another Role with a different access setup, or by directly overriding certain Access Flags on the Users themselves.

If no access is defined for a User or Role on a particular object, the access model assumes that all the Flags are set to Deny.

New Objects
-----------

When a User creates a new object in Micetro, the object is afforded a certain default access based on the initial access settings for the object type. To define initial access settings for different object types, do the following:

1. From the menu bar, select :menuselection:`Tools --> Initial Access For`.

2. Select the object type for which you want to set the initial access. The Access Control dialog box displays.

3. Set the desired access for new objects and click :guilabel:`OK`.

Edit Access Flag
----------------

Each object type has an Access Flag named *Edit Access*. This flag is special in that it directs a User, Group's or Role's access to the object's access information. In other words, if a User has this flag set on an object, he may edit the Access Flags for the object. This means that the User could remove a different User or Group from the object completely. He could even remove the User that created the object. In light of this, the Edit Access flag should be treated with care.

Access for Built-in groups is impossible to change. However, it would be possible to shut out all Users in Micetro from a certain object by simply editing access for each User directly. You could even shut yourself out. The Administrator User will always have full access to every object, so if such situations arise, the Administrator User should be used to set things straight.

Access Control Dialog Box
-------------------------

Through the Access Control module, you select groups/users for which you want to manage permissions.

The Access Control dialog box is used to define access to individual objects in the system. To define access for an object, right-click the object and choose :guilabel:`Access` from the popup menu.

To define access for individual components of Micetro, select :menuselection:`Tools --> Global Access`. The Access Control for Micetro dialog box displays. The default groups/user names are shown. The permissions for any selected group/user are also shown.

Edit access controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. While viewing the Access Control dialog box, click the Add button. The Select user, group or role dialog box displays.

.. image:: ../../images/admin-permissions-select-user.png
  :width: 50%
  :align: center

2. Highlight the user, group and/or role for which you want to assign permissions.

3. Click the :guilabel:`Select` button.

4. When you return to the main dialog box, the user/group is highlighted in the list of users and groups.

.. image:: ../../images/admin-access-controls-console.png
  :width: 70%
  :align: center

5. To specify the permissions for this selected group/user/role, do the following:

  * Move to the Permission for [group/user/role selected] list.

  * Click in the checkbox for each permission you want to Allow or Deny.

  .. note::
    It is not necessary to select Deny unless you want to ensure that a user/group/role does not have permission to a specific object. However, if you do not specify the permission for an individual user, but the group(s) or role(s) to which the user belong does Allow access to that object, the user (by default) also has access.

6. When all selections are made, click :guilabel:`OK`. The dialog box closes.

7. Repeat the above for any additional groups/users.

Initial Access For
------------------

Through this function, you specify access privileges that should be set for objects when they are created. This function is identical to the Access Model and Permissions function except that a new user type – "Creator" (Meta user) - is used to specify the access privileges that should be set for the object creator.

.. note::
  The access control dialog box for IP Address Ranges and Scopes contains a checkbox, 'IP Address Ranges/Scopes inherit access by default'. If this checkbox is checked, a new range or scope will inherit all access bits from its parent. For more information on inherited access, refer to  IP Address Management—Range Access.

From the menu bar, select :menuselection:`Tools --> Initial Access For`, and then the object type for which you want to set the initial access. The Access Control dialog box displays. Refer to :ref:`global-access` for details on working with this dialog box.
